        <p class="bold">Yes, this is still my resume! </p>
        <p> But I promised it would be different and I will try not to fail with your expectation.
          Therefore, I will start with a story and then realize what intention is.</p>

        <p>Some time ago, while sitting at the coffee, at the table next door were two men, in the
           30s house, the coffee was poorly moved and I ended up starting to pay attention to
           their conversation.
        </p>
        <p>One said he wanted only one woman, while the other emphasized that he liked to marry
           with more than one. The first unbeliever asks him: But why? Put up with a woman
           is it already as complicated the more we put up with several?
        </p>
        <p> I was curious about the development of the conversation, as you might imagine… and especially with
            what would be the argument to defend is idea.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, if you have more women all will have different abilities to solve
          different problems, which means you will worry much less…
        </p>
        <p class="gold">I was amazed, not with the polygamous and monogamous perspective, but how it adapts
          to our abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have already thought of how people with monogamous skills usually always have an order
          to protect them, such as lawyers, doctors, etc. as people with skills
          do not have such protection? Examples? Entrepreneurs, Marketeers, programmers…
        </p>
        <p>
          These people always need to be inside the last in the market!
          They are always learning and constantly innovating and testing!
        </p>

        <p class="color">LOVE IT!</p>
        <p>
          I want to learn, I don't want to stand still, I don't want to get the full sense of getting lost
          my job will not know how to do anything else.

        <p class=" black-text">Well, I am licensed and I have two masters, already belonged to an order, 
           mainly because it was necessary if you were interested in doing
           blood collection. The masters were in clinical analysis and food security. Internship
           at the<span class="gold">Coimbra IPO</span> and at <span class="gold">CoimbraLab</span>  
           (now Unilabs).
        </p>

        <p class="black-text">At the end of this adventure I was offered a <span class = "gold" project>
          Research at the University of Coimbra</span>, where we tested the effect of the lights
          LED-UV-C in viruses similar to Sars-Cov, another great experience!
        </p>

        <p class="black-text extra_spacing">
          I had already applied to <span class="gold">Bluepharma</span> and I was called, I did
          the work of quality control technician in microbiology, at the beginning was funny,
          but I got bored after a few months, that's when I found that I need constant stimuli.
        </p>
        <p class=" black-text">
          I started creating stock Excel files for culture media.
        </p>
        <p class=" black-text">
          I have to admit, I found it a waste of time to tell, almost all days, the quantities of culture means, I tried to make the process more effective.
          <br> Still today is used !!
        </p>
        <p class="gold">
          At the end of the internship I did not renew contract and went home without a plan!
        </p>

        <p class="black-text extra_spacing">
          While I was unemployed I learned about programming (this website is the proof, other projects
          in the images below), social networking management, marketing, copywriting, I wasn't standing still.

          Literally I took the opportunity to learn in online courses and to read books.

        <p class=" black-text">
          Well, work for <span class = "gold"> University of Coimbra </span> to organize events
          in the area of pedagogical innovation & entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p class=" black-text">
          Among other things, in this little time I already have in the curriculum: creation of
          websites, social networking management and content creation to attract people to
          events; contact with suppliers; a lot of stress management, yes, there are days that only
          I feel like screaming for a pillow; distance work in long-term projects;
          among many others.

        <h3 class="gold extra_spacing">What I can offer is:</h3>
        <ul class="black-text">
          <li>
            A good work ethics;
          </li>
          <li>
            An exceptional commitment to everything I do;
          </li>
          <li>
            Desire to learn;
          </li>
          <li>
            Sympathy for co-workers and/or customers, maintaining a good environment;
          </li>
          <li>
            I know how to work under pressure, however I like to have time to do things with the
            calm down and dedicate them to the time they deserve;
          </li>
          <li>
            I hate to waste time with things that can be done quickly, always looking for
            improve processes that take too long;
          </li>
          
        </ul>

        <h3 class="gold extra_spacing">My preferences? </h3>
        <p class="black-text">I preferred to work remotely, however I am open to others
          opportunities. 
          <br> I could say so much about me, as how funny it was, organize the Innovation Days
          after my team won the prize in 2019 and went to Paris to present the idea,
          or as I participated in so many other events while at university, but probably
          it would have no interest to you, so I tried to force what it was important.

        <p class="black-text bold extra_spacing">I hope I have not failed your expectations!</p>
