        <p class="bold">Yes, this is still my resume! </p>
        <p> But I promised it would be different and I will try not to fail your expectation. 
          So I will start with a story and then you will understand what the intention is.</p>

        <p>A while ago, while sitting in the coffee shop, at the next table were two men, 
          about 30 years old, the coffee shop was not very busy and I started to pay attention 
          to their conversation.
        <p>One said he only wanted one woman, while the other emphasized that he would like
           to marry more than one. The first one incredulously asks him: But why? Dealing 
           with one woman is already so complicated, how can you want to have to deal with several?
        </p>
        <p>I was curious as the conversation unfolded, as you can imagine... and especially what 
          the argument would be to defend this idea.
        </p>
        <p>He answered: "Sure, if you have more women, they will all have different abilities 
          to solve different problems, which means you will have to worry a lot less."
        </p>
        <p class="gold">I was amazed, not at the polygamist and monogamist perspective, 
          but at how this idea fits our abilities.

        <p>
          Have you ever thought about how people with monogamous abilities always have
          an order to protect them, like lawyers, doctors, etc., while people with multiple 
          abilities have no such protection? Examples? Entrepreneurs, marketers, programmers...
        </p>
        <p>
          These people always need to be up to date with the latest news in the market! 
          They are always learning, innovating and testing!
        </p>

        <p class="color">I LOVE IT!</p>
        <p>
          I want to learn, I don't want to stand still, I don't want to have the feeling 
          that if I lose my job I won't know how to do anything else.

        <p class=" black-text">Well, I have a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees, 
          I used to belong to an order, mainly because it was necessary if I was interested in 
          doing blood collection. The masters were in clinical analysis and food safety. 
          I did internships at the<span class="gold">IPO of Coimbra</span> and at <span class="gold">CoimbraLab</span>  
           (now Unilabs).
        </p>

        <p class="black-text">At the end of this adventure I was proposed a 
        <span class = "gold" project> Research project at the University of Coimbra</span>, 
        where we tested the effect of LED-UV-C lights on viruses similar to Sars-Cov, 
        another great experience! </p>

        <p class="black-text extra_spacing">
          I had already applied to <span class="gold">Bluepharma</span> and I was called, I did
          the work of quality control technician in microbiology,  at first it was fun, but I got 
          bored after a few months, that's when I discovered that I need constant stimulation.
        </p> 
        <p class=" black-text">
          I started creating stock Excel files for culture media.
        </p>
        <p class=" black-text">
          I have to admit, I found it a waste of time to count, almost every day, 
          the quantities of culture media, I tried to make the process more efficient.
          <br> It is still used today !!!
        </p>
        <p class="gold">
          At the end of the internship I did not renew my contract and went home without a plan!
        </p>

        <p class="black-text extra_spacing">
          While unemployed I learned about programming (this site is proof, other projects in 
          the images below), social media management, marketing, copywriting, I didn't stand still.

          I literally took the opportunity to learn in online courses and to read books.

        <h2 class="gold extra_spacing">What did I do next?</h2>

        <p class=" black-text">
          Well, I started working for the <span class = "gold"> University of Coimbra </span> 
          organizing events in the area of pedagogical innovation & entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p class=" black-text">
          Among other things, in this short time I already have in my resume: 
          website creation, social network management and content creation to 
          attract people to the events, contact with suppliers, a lot of stress management,
          working remotely in long term projects, among many others.

        <h3 class="gold extra_spacing">What I can offer is:</h3>
        <ul class="black-text">
          <li>
            A good work ethics;
          </li>
          <li>
            An exceptional commitment to everything I do;
          </li>
          <li>
            Desire to learn;
          </li>
          <li>
            Sympathy for co-workers and/or customers, maintaining a good environment;
          </li>
          <li>
            I know how to work under pressure, however I like to take my time to do 
            things calmly and give them the time they deserve;
          </li>
          <li>
            I hate wasting time on things that can be done quickly, 
            always trying to improve processes that take too much time;
          </li>
          
        </ul>

        <h3 class="gold extra_spacing">My preferences? </h3>
        <p class="black-text">I prefer to work remotely, but I am open to other opportunities.
          <br> I could say so much about myself, like how fun it was to organize Innovation Days 
          after my team won the prize in 2019 and went to Paris to present the idea, or how I 
          participated in so many other events while I was at university, but it probably wouldn't 
          be of interest to you, so I tried to reinforce what was important.
        </p>
        <p class="black-text bold extra_spacing">I hope I haven't failed your expectations!</p>
